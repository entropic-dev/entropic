# Installing `ds`

Entropic requires a new command-line client, called `ds` (or "entropy delta".) **`ds` requires at least Node 12.** Install the cli:

```sh
curl -sSL https://www.entropic.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Or with Brew on Mac:

```sh
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/entropic-dev/entropic/master/docs/installing/homebrew/ds.rb
```
